# Tuguegarao City Location Constraint - PR Summary

## Overview
This PR implements geographical boundary validation to ensure incident reports can only be submitted for locations within Tuguegarao City, as requested in the issue.

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Utility Module
Created `lib/utils/geoBounds.ts` with:
- Tuguegarao City boundary definitions (bounding box)
- `isWithinTuguegaraoBounds()` function for validation
- Generic `isWithinBounds()` function for future extensibility

### 2. Location Validation Points
Added boundary checks at **3 critical points** where users can select locations:

#### a) Map Selection (`LocationStep.tsx`)
When users tap on the map to select a location, the coordinates are validated before accepting them.

#### b) Address Search (`LocationStep.tsx`)
When users search for and select an address, the resulting coordinates are validated.

#### c) GPS/Current Location (`report-incident/index.tsx`)
When users use the "Use Current Location" feature, their GPS coordinates are validated.

### 3. User Feedback
When a location outside Tuguegarao City is selected, users see a clear dialog:
```
Title: "Location Not Supported"
Message: "The selected location is outside Tuguegarao City. This app currently only supports reporting incidents within Tuguegarao City."
```

## Technical Details

### Tuguegarao City Boundaries
The implementation uses a bounding box with these coordinates:
- **North**: 17.68°
- **South**: 17.56°
- **East**: 121.76°
- **West**: 121.65°

These bounds encompass the entire city including suburban areas.

### Validation Logic
```typescript
function isWithinTuguegaraoBounds(lat: number, lon: number): boolean {
  return (
    lat >= 17.56 && lat <= 17.68 &&
    lon >= 121.65 && lon <= 121.76
  );
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive test suite with **18 test cases** covering:
- Valid coordinates within the city
- Edge cases at each boundary
- Invalid coordinates outside the city
- Far outside coordinates (e.g., Manila)
- Custom bounds validation

To run tests:
```bash
bun test lib/utils/__tests__/geoBounds.test.ts
```

### Manual Testing
See `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed manual testing instructions.

## Code Quality

✅ **Minimal Changes**: Only modified what was necessary  
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Fully backward compatible  
✅ **Well Tested**: Comprehensive unit test coverage  
✅ **Documented**: Includes implementation guide and flow diagrams  
✅ **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript type definitions  
✅ **Reusable**: Generic bounds checking function included  

## How It Works

```
User selects location
        ↓
Extract coordinates (lat, lon)
        ↓
Check: isWithinTuguegaraoBounds(lat, lon)
        ↓
    ┌───┴───┐
    ↓       ↓
  TRUE    FALSE
    ↓       ↓
 Accept   Show
location  Error
   & 
Continue
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Server-Side Validation**: Add boundary checking on the backend for security
2. **Visual Feedback**: Show the boundary on the map with a highlighted overlay
3. **Configurable Bounds**: Allow admins to adjust boundaries through config
4. **Multiple Cities**: Extend to support other cities in the future
