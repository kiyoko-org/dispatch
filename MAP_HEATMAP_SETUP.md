# Crime Heatmap Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a crime heatmap on the map page with individual crime markers using data from crimes.csv.

## What Was Done

### 1. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created `.env` file with:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`

### 2. Android Configuration
- ✅ Added Google Maps API key to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- ✅ Added Google Play Services dependencies to `android/app/build.gradle`:
  - `play-services-maps:18.2.0`
  - `play-services-location:21.0.1`

### 3. Map Component Implementation
Updated `app/(protected)/map/index.tsx` with:

#### Features:
- **🗺️ Interactive Map**: Google Maps integration with MapView
- **🔥 Heatmap Layer**: Visual representation of crime density using gradient colors:
  - Green → Yellow → Red (low to high crime density)
  - Opacity: 0.7
  - Radius: 50
- **📍 Individual Markers**: Each crime has a marker with:
  - Color-coded by crime type:
    - 🔴 Red: Murder/Homicide
    - 🟠 Orange: Robbery/Theft
    - 🔴 Light Red: Other crimes
  - Title: Incident type
  - Description: Location and date
- **📊 Crime Details Card**: Displays detailed information when marker is tapped:
  - Incident type
  - Location (Barangay, Municipal)
  - Date and time
  - Place type
  - Offense details
- **🎯 User Location**: Shows current user location on map
- **📈 Crime Count Badge**: Displays total number of crimes
- **➕ Report Button**: Quick access to report new incidents

### 4. Data Processing
- CSV parsing using Papa Parse library
- Filters valid lat/lon coordinates
- Maps 566 crimes from Tuguegarao City (2023 data)

### 5. Map Configuration
- Initial region centered on Tuguegarao City:
  - Latitude: 17.6132
  - Longitude: 121.7270
  - Delta: 0.15 (zoom level)
